# Linux-Phone-Mod

This will install some needed apps and apply customizations on Debian based phones.

This will work on *any* Debian linux based system based on gnome. This includes Droidian, Mobian, Ubuntu Touch, and PureOS.

This is in active testing/daily driving on:
- Google Pixel 3a
  - Droidian Phosh
  - Ubuntu Touch
- Librem 5
  - PureOS
  - Mobian Phosh
 
Will update often until its actually usable, this will never be stable as all linux phone OS are in testing.



The script will:
  - Install depends
  - Add Flathub and Brew Repos.
  - Install a selections of apps 
    - Neovim Nightly
    - Yazi
    - Gnome Tweaks
    - 
- From there it will slap on the minimum I need for a daily driver linux device.
- The same .bashrc used in all PiercingXX Repo's also works here. 



This will take several hours to fully run even with performance turned on.
